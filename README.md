# Weather-app

> I had to build a single-page application for a Weather for learning purposes, for this project I learn about webpacker, Javascript, Javascript DOM, and API data fetching. The project has only one section. This project section is rendered dynamically by DOM manipulation, and the use of modularized code using webpack.
